**Ethereum Block and USDT Balance Fetcher**

---

### Overview

This GitHub project serves as a solution for a technical task assigned by (Confidential). The task primarily involves fetching the last block number of the Ethereum mainnet and displaying the USDT balance of a provided Ethereum address.

### Features

- Fetches the last block number of the Ethereum mainnet using Alchemy SDK.
- Retrieves the USDT balance of the provided Ethereum address using the Ethereum Scan API key.
- Built using React with TypeScript for a robust and type-safe solution.
- Utilizes React-create-app (RCA) for tooling and Jest for unit testing.

### Usage

To run the tests, simply execute the following command:

```
npm run test
```

### Learning Experience

Developing this solution provided valuable learning experiences, particularly in TypeScript and unit testing. The use of React-create-app helped in configuring Jest properly for testing, enhancing the overall development process. Along the way, I also learned how to develop NPM packages and created a special npm package that encapsulates the basic functionality.
